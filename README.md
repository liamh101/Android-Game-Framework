# Android-Game-Framework
A framework built in Java to easily build a video game in Android. 

This is a Android based Framework to implement Graphics,Audio, Input and a GameLoop for a video game. This is so I can quickly create a video game without having to remake a framework everytime. This framework is make to be modular so I can quickly drop in and out unneeded classes and build upon features within the framework.

This framework is based on James Cho's,Mario Zechner' and Robert Green's designs but fully implemented by myself alone with all the code in the example project. This was made over a peroid of a week in my own time. 

Master holds the main framework. 

Example holds an semi-port of my "Java-Platformer-Engine" game found here https://github.com/liamh101/Java-Platformer-Engine
